# RedisProofOfConcept

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/).

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options". Create your own
`application-local.properties` file to override settings for development.

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing -
[learn more](https://bootify.io/next-steps/spring-boot-with-lombok.html).

In addition to the Spring Boot application, the development server must also be started - for this
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 20 is required. Angular CLI and required dependencies must be installed once:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
```

The development server can be started as follows:

```
ng serve
```

Your application is now accessible under `localhost:4200`.

Add code using Angular schematics with `ng generate ...`.
Frontend unit tests can be executed with `ng test`.
Generate a messages.json for translation with `ng extract-i18n –format=json`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
gradlew clean build
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./build/libs/redis-proof-of-concept-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as
environment variable when running the container.

```
gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=com.poc/redis-proof-of-concept
```
